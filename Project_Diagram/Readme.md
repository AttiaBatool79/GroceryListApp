# 📂 Project Diagram

The `Project_Diagram` folder contains the **ER diagram** and **Relational Model** of the database design for the project.

### 📁 What's inside the `Project_Diagram` folder:

1. **ER Diagram (ER Diagram.png)**  
   - Visual representation of the database schema.  
   - Shows the entities, relationships, and key constraints.  
   - Helps in understanding how different tables relate to each other.

2. **Relational Model (Relational model.png)**  
   - Contains the **SQL code** to create the database tables and their relationships.  
   - Includes the definition of all **tables** and **attributes (columns)** along with primary and foreign keys.

### Why these are important:
- The **ER diagram** provides a clear, easy-to-understand overview of the database structure.
- The **Relational Model** gives the exact SQL code needed to create the database and manage its relationships.

These diagrams are essential for understanding the database design and how the application will interact with the data.
